# Next.js 15 Navigation Issue with useRouter

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with client-side navigation in Next.js 15 when using the `useRouter` hook.  The issue involves unexpected behavior in UI updates when navigating between pages.

## Description

The problem arises from the way client-side navigation and component re-rendering interact. If not properly handled, updates to the UI after navigation can be delayed or incomplete, causing flickering or the UI not reflecting the new page's content correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the "Go back to Home" button.  Observe any unexpected behavior such as flickering, delayed UI updates, or incorrect content display.

## Solution

The solution often involves ensuring that the components are correctly re-rendering after navigation and that state updates are handled appropriately using techniques like asynchronous loading of data or strategic use of `useEffect` hooks to manage state after navigation.
